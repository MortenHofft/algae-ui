> First take on a UI library for GBIF

## Get Started

**Currently this is only testing and only runs in storybook**

You can easily develop and interact with your components by using Storybook. To run the local server, simply run:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run storybook
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view your stories. They should automatically update as you develop.
